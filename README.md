# Network Analysis

A repo to analyze the network, with a special focus on subnets and validators.

## Emissions

The Root Network notebook shows the distribution of weights from validators, and their change for the last month. Only the top 5 are displayed, but you can easily make the graph for any other validator.

## Emissions

This folder contains a notebook analyzing the historical emissions on specific subnets.

## Registrations

This folder contains code fetching the TAO recycled for specific periods, across one or multiple subnets.

## Weekly Rankings

Every week, we publish a ranking of subnets and validators on our [Medium](https://medium.com/@mentatminds), based on the [weekly-rankings](https://github.com/Mentat-Minds/network-analysis/blob/main/rankings/weekly-rankings.ipynb) file.
